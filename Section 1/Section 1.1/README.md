# Section 1.1
### Comparasion between GPU and CPU
-------------
- The Graphics Processing Unit(GPU) provides higher memory bandwidth and instructions throughput as compared to the CPU within the same power usage.
- GPUs have more transistors dedicated to data processing(e.g. float point computation), while CPUs have more transistors decided to cache and control flow.
- GPUs are specifically designed for parallel computing. Recent GPUs can execute thousands of threads(a sequence of operations) parallelly, but they have lower single-thread performance than CPUs.
